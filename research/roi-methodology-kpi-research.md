## 1. CX/UX ROI Frameworks

### 1.1 Forrester CX Index Framework

- **What it is:** Forrester's CX Index links customers' perceptions of CX quality to loyalty and then to specific revenue drivers. It has been tracking brand CX quality annually since 2016.
- **How it quantifies impact:** Connects CX quality scores to three loyalty outcomes: retention, enrichment (upsell/cross-sell), and advocacy. Brands that structure processes around consumer needs show **41% faster revenue growth**, **49% faster profit growth**, and **51% better customer retention** vs. non-customer-focused brands.
- **Headline ROI stat:** Forrester research found that **every $1 invested in UX yields $100 in return** (9,900% ROI). This is from a paid Forrester report and is the most widely cited UX ROI figure in the industry.
- **2024-2025 trend context:** CX quality is at an all-time low in the US (25% of brands declined, only 7% improved). This is a selling point for the tool -- there is a widening CX gap, meaning more opportunity.

- **Availability:** Methodology details behind paywall (Forrester Decisions). Top-line stats are publicly citable.

### 1.2 McKinsey Design Index (MDI)

- **What it is:** A 2018 McKinsey study that, for the first time, linked design practices to financial performance. Tracked 300 publicly listed companies over 5 years across multiple countries and industries.
- **How it quantifies impact:** Created the McKinsey Design Index (MDI) based on four capabilities: analytical leadership, cross-functional talent, continuous iteration, and user experience.
- **Key findings:**
  - Top-quartile MDI companies generated **32 percentage points higher revenue growth** and **56 percentage points more total return to shareholders** than industry counterparts over a 5-year period.
  - Revenue and TRS growth at nearly **2x the rate** of lower-quartile peers.
- **Four success factors:** (1) Analytical leadership, (2) Cross-functional talent, (3) Continuous iteration, (4) User experience as everyone's responsibility.

### 1.3 DMI Design Value Index (DVI)

- **What it is:** Created in 2013 by Jeneanne Rae (Motiv Strategies) in collaboration with the Design Management Institute. Tracks a portfolio of design-led public companies against the S&P 500.
- **Key findings:**
  - Design-led companies **outperformed the S&P 500 by 228%** over a 10-year period (2003-2013).
  - By 2016, the outperformance was **211% over the S&P 500** -- third consecutive year above 200%.
  - Companies in the index include Apple, IBM, Nike, Procter & Gamble, Starbucks.

### 1.4 Watermark Consulting CX ROI Study

- **What it is:** Longitudinal stock market study comparing CX Leaders vs. CX Laggards vs. S&P 500, using Forrester CX Index (2007-2015), Temkin Experience Ratings (2016-2018), and Qualtrics XMI Customer Ratings (2019-2023).
- **Key findings:**
  - CX Leaders outperformed the S&P 500 by **over 260 percentage points** in cumulative total return.
  - CX Laggards trailed the S&P 500 by **more than 175 percentage points**.
  - CX Leaders generated **5.4x greater total return** than CX Laggards.
  - Results span 15+ years covering full economic cycles (expansions and recessions).
- **Why it matters for CPROI:** This is the single strongest "stock market proof" that CX investment drives shareholder value. Extremely compelling for CFO audiences.

### 1.5 Temkin Group / Qualtrics XM Institute ROI Model

- **What it is:** Research based on 10,000 US consumers across 318 companies in 20 industries. Links Temkin Experience Ratings (TxR) to loyalty and revenue.
- **Headline finding:** A moderate CX improvement generates an average **$823 million in additional revenue over 3 years** for a $1 billion-revenue company.
- **Industry variation:** Rental car agencies have the most to gain ($967M per $1B revenue); utilities the least ($645M per $1B revenue).
- **CX components:** Success + Effort + Emotion. **Emotion drives the most significant increase in loyalty.**
- **Correlation strength:** Correlation between CX and repurchasing = **R = 0.82** (very high).
- **Five-step ROI model:**
  1. Determine a Core CX Metric (linked to financial metrics)
  2. Set Achievable Goals
  3. Identify Key Drivers (journey-level, not just touchpoints)
  4. Establish Key Driver Metrics (operational, behavioral, journey -- not just NPS/CSAT)
  5. Make the Suite of Metrics Actionable

- **Key finding:** Organizations experienced an ROI of **301%** from IBM's design thinking approach.
- **Source:** [Forrester TEI of IBM Design Thinking](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/customer-effort-score) (IBM reference)

### 1.8 Academic/Peer-Reviewed Research Summary

- Limited pure academic literature exists on CX/UX ROI specifically. The strongest peer-reviewed adjacent research includes:
  - Brand experience and willingness-to-pay premium studies (ScienceDirect, ResearchGate -- see Section 2.6 below)
  - CEB/Gartner research on Customer Effort Score and loyalty (2010 foundational study)
  - London School of Economics study on NPS and revenue correlation (2005)
- **Gap:** Most CX ROI evidence comes from industry research (Forrester, McKinsey, Temkin) rather than academic journals. This is normal for applied fields but should be noted in audit trails.

## 4. Calculation Methodology

### 4.1 Concrete Example: $500M Revenue Retailer

**Scenario:** A Client Partner enters "Acme Retail Corp" (fictional), $500M revenue, industry = "Retail/Ecommerce"

#### Step 1: Gather Company-Specific Inputs

| Input | Source | Example Value |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| Annual Revenue | 10-K filing / SEC EDGAR | $500,000,000 |
| Online Revenue % | 10-K or estimate | 40% ($200M) |
| Website Traffic (annual unique visitors) | SimilarWeb estimate or company data | 50,000,000 |
| Current Conversion Rate | Estimated from industry or company data | 2.5% |
| Average Order Value | Calculated: Online Revenue / (Traffic x Conv Rate) | $160 |
| Current Churn / Retention Rate | Industry benchmark or company data | 25% annual churn |
| Customer Count | Estimated or company-reported | 1,250,000 |
| Customer Support Contacts / Year | Estimate from industry data | 2,000,000 |
| Cost per Support Contact | Industry benchmark | $8 |
| Current NPS | Industry benchmark (Retail: ~55) | 55 |

#### Step 2: Apply Benchmark Ranges (by Scenario)

| Metric | Conservative | Moderate | Aggressive | Source |
|--------|-------------|----------|------------|--------|
| Conversion Rate Lift | +10% | +20% | +35% | Arounda, Contentsquare |
| AOV Increase | +5% | +10% | +20% | McKinsey personalization |
| Churn Reduction | -5% | -15% | -25% | Temkin Group, Vitally |
| Support Ticket Reduction | -10% | -25% | -40% | Userpilot, Pylon |
| NPS Improvement | +5 pts | +10 pts | +15 pts | CustomerGauge |

#### Step 3: Calculate Impact (Moderate Scenario)

**A. Revenue from Conversion Rate Improvement**
```
Current online revenue = $200,000,000
Conversion lift = +20%
New conversion rate = 2.5% x 1.20 = 3.0%
Incremental revenue = $200M x 0.20 = $40,000,000/year
```

**B. Revenue from AOV Increase**
```
Current AOV = $160
AOV lift = +10%
New AOV = $176
Revenue on existing conversions = 1,250,000 orders x $16 uplift = $20,000,000/year
```

**C. Revenue from Churn Reduction (Retention)**
```
Current churn = 25% (312,500 customers lost/year)
Churn reduction = -15% (relative) -> new churn = 21.25%
Customers saved = 312,500 x 0.15 = 46,875
Revenue per customer = $400/year (estimated)
Retained revenue = 46,875 x $400 = $18,750,000/year
```

**D. Cost Savings from Support Reduction**
```
Current support contacts = 2,000,000/year
Cost per contact = $8
Ticket reduction = -25%
Contacts eliminated = 500,000
Cost savings = 500,000 x $8 = $4,000,000/year
```

**E. Revenue from NPS Improvement (Referral/Advocacy)**
```
NPS improvement = +10 points
Revenue growth correlation = 10 pts / 7 = 1.43% revenue growth (LSE formula)
Incremental revenue = $500M x 0.0143 = $7,150,000/year
```

#### Step 4: Total Impact Summary

| Impact Area | Conservative | Moderate | Aggressive |
|------------|-------------|----------|------------|
| Conversion Revenue | $20,000,000 | $40,000,000 | $70,000,000 |
| AOV Revenue | $10,000,000 | $20,000,000 | $40,000,000 |
| Retention Revenue | $6,250,000 | $18,750,000 | $31,250,000 |
| Support Cost Savings | $1,600,000 | $4,000,000 | $6,400,000 |
| NPS/Referral Revenue | $3,575,000 | $7,150,000 | $10,725,000 |
| **TOTAL ANNUAL IMPACT** | **$41,425,000** | **$89,900,000** | **$158,375,000** |
| **As % of Revenue** | **8.3%** | **18.0%** | **31.7%** |

#### Step 5: Calculate ROI

```
Assuming a $2M experience design engagement:

Conservative ROI = ($41.4M - $2M) / $2M = 1,971% (19.7x)
Moderate ROI    = ($89.9M - $2M) / $2M = 4,395% (44.0x)
Aggressive ROI  = ($158.4M - $2M) / $2M = 7,819% (78.2x)
```

> **Note:** These are annualized impact figures assuming full realization. A more honest framing would show Year 1 (30-50% realization), Year 2 (60-80%), Year 3 (80-100%) with a 3-year cumulative view.

### 4.2 Handling Confidence Intervals and Ranges

**Three-scenario model (recommended):**
- **Conservative:** Lower-bound benchmarks, higher discount rates, slower realization timeline. Use this as the "floor" that you are confident about. **Present this as "Even in the most conservative case..."**
- **Moderate:** Median benchmarks, standard assumptions. **Present this as "Based on industry data, the likely outcome is..."**
- **Aggressive:** Upper-bound benchmarks, faster realization. **Present this as "If the engagement performs in the top quartile..."**

**Realization curve (time to value):**
- Year 1: 30-50% of projected impact (design + initial implementation)
- Year 2: 60-80% of projected impact (optimization + adoption)
- Year 3: 80-100% of projected impact (full maturity)

**Confidence flagging in audit trail:**
- **High confidence:** Company-specific data (from filings, reported metrics)
- **Medium confidence:** Industry-specific benchmarks from Tier 1 sources
- **Low confidence:** Cross-industry averages, estimated inputs, older data (>3 years)

**Discount factors by data quality:**
```
Company-reported data:     1.0x multiplier (no discount)
Industry-specific benchmark: 0.8x multiplier (20% discount)
Cross-industry average:      0.6x multiplier (40% discount)
Estimated/extrapolated:      0.4x multiplier (60% discount)
```

### 4.3 Industry Vertical Adjustments

The tool should adjust calculations based on industry because CX impact varies significantly:

| Industry | CX Revenue Multiplier (per $1B) | Primary Impact Levers | Notes |
|----------|-------------------------------|----------------------|-------|
| Rental Cars | $967M (highest) | Repeat purchase, satisfaction | Highly competitive, experience-driven |
| Retail/Ecommerce | $program varies | Conversion, AOV, churn | Digital + physical touchpoints |
| Hotels | $program varies | Loyalty, premium pricing, referral | Experience is the product |
| Banking/Financial Services | $program varies | Churn reduction, CLV, trust | High switching costs, but high churn |
| Insurance | $program varies | Retention, claims CX, digital adoption | NPS leader (80 avg) |
| SaaS/Technology | $program varies | Churn, feature adoption, onboarding | Low churn = high impact (recurring revenue) |
| Healthcare | $program varies | Patient satisfaction, compliance, digital adoption | Regulatory complexity |
| Utilities | $645M (lowest) | Cost reduction, self-service, digital adoption | Limited competitive switching |

**Vertical-specific KPI weighting:**
- **Retail/Ecommerce:** Weight conversion rate and AOV highest (60%), retention (25%), efficiency (15%)
- **SaaS:** Weight churn/retention highest (50%), feature adoption (25%), conversion (25%)
- **Financial Services:** Weight churn/retention highest (40%), trust/NPS (30%), digital self-service (30%)
- **Healthcare:** Weight patient satisfaction (35%), efficiency (35%), digital adoption (30%)

### 4.4 Revenue at Risk vs. Revenue Opportunity

**Revenue at Risk (Defensive Frame)**
- **Definition:** Revenue you will LOSE if CX is not improved. Anchored to current churn, competitive threats, declining satisfaction.
- **Formula:** `Revenue at Risk = (Current Churn Rate x CLV x Customer Base) + (NPS Detractor % x Revenue Contribution of Detractors)`
- **Powered by:** Customer Value-at-Risk (CVaR) framework from MSU CXM research
- **When to use:** For risk-averse audiences (CFOs), companies already seeing CX decline, competitive threat situations
- **Example:** "Based on your current 25% churn rate and declining NPS, $125M of your annual revenue is at risk from customer defection over the next 3 years."

**Revenue Opportunity (Offensive Frame)**
- **Definition:** Revenue you COULD GAIN by improving CX to industry-leading levels
- **Formula:** `Revenue Opportunity = SUM(metric improvements x revenue impact) across all applicable KPIs`
- **Powered by:** Earned Growth Rate (EGR) framework
- **When to use:** For growth-oriented audiences (CMOs, CPOs), companies in expanding markets, digital transformation initiatives
- **Example:** "By bringing your digital experience to top-quartile industry standards, the data suggests $90M in incremental annual revenue opportunity."

**Best practice: Present BOTH.** Lead with Revenue at Risk to create urgency, then present Revenue Opportunity to show upside. The gap between the two is the "total CX value envelope."

## 5. Narrative Framing

### 5.1 Top Consulting Firm Narrative Structures

#### McKinsey SCR Framework (Situation-Complication-Resolution)
- **Situation:** "Your company generates $500M in revenue with a growing digital channel."
- **Complication:** "But your digital experience trails industry leaders -- your conversion rate is 30% below top-quartile peers, and NPS has declined 8 points in 2 years."
- **Resolution:** "An experience design engagement targeting your top 3 digital friction points could unlock $40-90M in incremental annual revenue."

#### ROI Institute Five-Level Evaluation
1. **Reaction:** Stakeholder alignment and enthusiasm
2. **Learning:** Organizational capability improvement
3. **Application:** Implementation of design improvements
4. **Business Impact:** Measurable KPI changes
5. **ROI:** Financial return vs. investment

**Best practice:** Include both narrative stories AND numbers -- six types of data across all five levels create the most convincing case.

### 5.2 Audience-Specific Framing

#### For CFOs (Finance-First)
- **Lead with:** Revenue at Risk, cost reduction, margin improvement
- **Language:** "Revenue protection," "cost avoidance," "margin expansion," "payback period"
- **Key proof points:**
  - Watermark CX stock study (5.4x CX Leaders vs. Laggards)
  - Temkin $823M per $1B revenue model
  - Support cost reduction ($4M savings example)
- **Presentation style:** Conservative scenario first, then upside. Show three scenarios with clear assumptions. Emphasize audit trail and data sources.
- **CFO credibility rules:**
  - Tie every metric to P&L line items
  - Use deductive reasoning (premises -> conclusion)
  - Show payback period (months, not just ROI %)
  - Never use percentages without absolute dollar amounts

#### For CMOs (Growth-First)
- **Lead with:** Revenue Opportunity, brand perception, competitive advantage
- **Language:** "Revenue growth," "market share," "brand premium," "customer acquisition efficiency"
- **Key proof points:**
  - McKinsey MDI (32% higher revenue growth for design leaders)
  - PwC willingness to pay 16% premium
  - NPS-revenue correlation (2.5x growth for top-quartile NPS)
- **Presentation style:** Moderate/aggressive scenarios, competitive benchmarking, customer voice data
- **CMO credibility rules:**
  - Combine quantitative data with customer narrative
  - Use inductive reasoning (examples -> pattern -> conclusion)
  - Show both defensive and offensive positioning
  - Translate to customer acquisition cost and LTV improvements

#### For CPOs / Chief Product Officers (Product-First)
- **Lead with:** User metrics, feature adoption, engagement, competitive product benchmarks
- **Language:** "Task completion," "time-to-value," "feature adoption," "user engagement," "product-led growth"
- **Key proof points:**
  - Task completion rate improvements (78% baseline -> 90%+ target)
  - App store rating impact (4.5+ = 3x downloads)
  - CES impact data (94% low-effort customers repurchase)
- **Presentation style:** Before/after usability metrics, competitive UX audits, user journey analysis

### 5.3 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-promising with unsubstantiated claims**
   - Do NOT cite the "$100 for every $1" stat without context (it is an average across all UX investments, not a guarantee for a specific engagement)
   - Always present ranges, not point estimates
   - Flag confidence levels on every data point

2. **Cherry-picking best-case scenarios**
   - Present conservative scenario first to establish credibility
   - Show the methodology, not just the result
   - Let the client see the assumptions and adjust

3. **Ignoring implementation reality**
   - ROI projections must include realization curves (not instant value)
   - Acknowledge that design alone does not create value -- implementation quality matters
   - Include a "what needs to be true" section for each projection

4. **Using stale benchmarks**
   - CX benchmarks shift over time (NPS baselines, conversion rates, churn expectations)
   - Always note the date of benchmark data
   - Apply a freshness discount to data >3 years old

5. **Failing to connect to the client's actual P&L**
   - Generic industry ROI means little; must be anchored to company-specific financials
   - Always show "for YOUR company, this means $X" not just "industry data says Y%"

6. **Conflating correlation with causation**
   - CX Leaders outperform in stock market -- but don't claim CX alone caused it
   - Use language like "companies that invest in CX tend to..." not "CX causes..."
   - Acknowledge confounding factors in the audit trail

7. **Measurement gap**
   - 70% of companies lack CX data linked to revenue (per industry research)
   - Only 2 in 5 CX leaders are "very confident" in measuring CX ROI
   - Position the CPROI tool as bridging this exact gap

### 5.4 Recommended Narrative Structure for CPROI Output

```
1. THE HEADLINE
   "[Company] has a $[X]M experience opportunity"

2. THE CONTEXT (Situation)
   - Company profile (revenue, industry, growth trajectory)
   - Current CX posture (estimated NPS, known issues, competitive position)

3. THE CASE (Complication)
   - Revenue at risk from CX gaps
   - Competitive CX benchmarks showing where they trail
   - Industry trend data (CX quality declining industry-wide = opportunity)

4. THE OPPORTUNITY (Resolution)
   Three scenarios (conservative / moderate / aggressive) with:
   - Total annual impact ($)
   - Breakdown by impact area (conversion, retention, efficiency, brand)
   - Realization timeline (Year 1 / Year 2 / Year 3)

5. THE PROOF
   - Methodology transparency (every number traceable)
   - Industry benchmark citations
   - Comparable case studies where available

6. THE AUDIT TRAIL
   - Every data point: source, date, confidence level
   - Every calculation: formula, inputs, output
   - Every benchmark: source, industry match, freshness
```

## 6. Key Formulas for the Calculation Engine

### Primary Formulas

```
# Total CX Impact (Annual)
Total_Impact = Conversion_Revenue_Lift + AOV_Revenue_Lift + Retention_Revenue_Saved
               + Support_Cost_Savings + NPS_Referral_Revenue

# Conversion Revenue Lift
Conv_Revenue_Lift = Current_Online_Revenue x Conversion_Lift_Percentage

# AOV Revenue Lift
AOV_Revenue_Lift = Current_Order_Volume x (New_AOV - Current_AOV)

# Retention Revenue Saved
Retention_Revenue = (Current_Churn_Rate x Churn_Reduction_%) x Customer_Count x Revenue_Per_Customer

# Support Cost Savings
Support_Savings = Current_Support_Contacts x Ticket_Reduction_% x Cost_Per_Contact

# NPS-Linked Revenue Growth
NPS_Revenue = Company_Revenue x (NPS_Point_Improvement / 7) x 0.01
# Based on LSE/Temkin formula: 7 NPS points = 1% revenue growth

# ROI Calculation
ROI = (Total_Impact - Engagement_Cost) / Engagement_Cost x 100

# Revenue at Risk (CVaR)
Revenue_at_Risk = (Churn_Rate x Customer_Count x CLV) + (Detractor_% x Detractor_Revenue_Share)

# Revenue Opportunity
Revenue_Opportunity = SUM(KPI_Improvement[i] x Revenue_Impact[i]) for all applicable KPIs

# Multi-Year with Realization Curve
Year1_Impact = Total_Impact x 0.40  # (30-50% realization)
Year2_Impact = Total_Impact x 0.70  # (60-80% realization)
Year3_Impact = Total_Impact x 0.90  # (80-100% realization)
Cumulative_3yr = Year1_Impact + Year2_Impact + Year3_Impact
```

### Confidence-Adjusted Formula

```
# Apply confidence discount to each component
Adjusted_Impact[i] = Raw_Impact[i] x Confidence_Multiplier[i]

where Confidence_Multiplier =
  1.0  for company-reported data
  0.8  for industry-specific benchmark (Tier 1 source)
  0.6  for cross-industry average
  0.4  for estimated/extrapolated data
```

## 7. Implications for CPROI Architecture

Based on this research, the calculation engine needs:

1. **A curated benchmark database** with ~50-100 data points covering:
   - Conversion rates by industry
   - Churn rates by industry
   - NPS benchmarks by industry
   - CX impact ranges (conservative/moderate/aggressive) by metric and industry
   - Support cost benchmarks
   - All with source citations and dates

2. **Industry vertical profiles** that weight KPIs appropriately (retail weights conversion/AOV; SaaS weights churn/adoption, etc.)

3. **Three-scenario engine** that applies conservative/moderate/aggressive multipliers to each benchmark

4. **Realization curve model** that distributes impact across a 3-year timeline

5. **Revenue at Risk AND Revenue Opportunity** dual framing capability

6. **Full audit trail** attached to every calculated number: source, date, confidence, formula

7. **Narrative generation** that adapts tone/framing based on target audience (CFO / CMO / CPO)
